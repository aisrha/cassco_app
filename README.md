# CASSCO Application

Mobile Application for Learning Cascading Style Sheets Concepts developed by Alifah Ilyana binti Soharto. This project is for final year project purposes only.

CASSCO is an application that will provide the learning materials and assessments for each topic to ensure that the students have a clear understanding of the topics simply by installing the application in their mobile phone. All learning materials and assessments will be on the secondary school level based on the KPM textbook to ensure that the knowledge gained from CASSCO can be applied in school and in real life.
